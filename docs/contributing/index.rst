============
Contributing
============

ApiHub is an open-source project, and as such, it grows due to the community help.
We greatly appreciate any kind of help you come up with: issues, pull request, feature
suggestions, and so on.

The main idea is not to create any kind of barrier. But, try to create a standard for
the contributions. If you think, for some reason, that's very bureaucratic, do not let
that stop you from submitting a patch/issue. Send us your contribution the way you are
familiar with.

Guidelines For Reporting An Issue/Feature
=========================================

Have you found any bug or have an awesome idea for a feature? If so, proceed with these:

  * Even though we have different repositories on Github, we're used to open all issues at https://github.com/apihub/apihub/issues. Please, check if there's an existing issue for the feature or bug you have found. If so, post a comment there.

  * If you don't find anything there, please open an issue with:

    * A simple description of either bug or feature;
    * If that's a bug and you know how to reproduce that, please tell us;
    * Even tho' we support different versions of Go, tell us which version you're using, along with the ApiHub Server/Cli versions.


Guidelines For Contributing Code
================================

We do appreciate pull requests with some code and docs. But we love well-tested code as well.
Please, make sure to add tests for your code before submitting a pull request.

* Fork the project on GitHub into your own account.
* Clone your copy of ApiHub.
* Make a new branch in git & commit your changes there.
* Push your new branch up to GitHub.
* If your patch is fixing any issue that's already opened on Github, please take a note of the issue number in your pull request.
* Create a new pull request, and please take a note of the issue number in your pull request, if there's an opened issue on Github.

And, **thank you a lot** for your contribution! ;-)
